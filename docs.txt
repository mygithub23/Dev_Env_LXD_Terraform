xs_storage_pool: the LXD storage pool storing the disks of our containers
xs_network: the LXD IPv4 network used by containers to communicate within a shared network
xs_profiles: the LXD profiles created for our containers. Profiles allow the definition of a set of properties that can be applied to any container.
xs_image: the LXD image. This essentially specifies which OS the containers run.
xs_containers: The LXD instances to create.



The following resources are created by Terraform:

lxd_network.xs_network: the network for all our instances
lxd_profile.xs_profiles: several profiles that can be defined by the user
lxd_container.xs_containers: the instancesâ€™ definitions (including the application of the profile and the network device attachment)
Variables file
Finally, we provide Terraform with the variables specific to our environment. We use the auto.tfvars extension to automatically load the variables when terraform is run.
